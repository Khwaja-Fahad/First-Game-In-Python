 Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

Randomized computer player: The computer player makes random choices (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round, creating an unpredictable gameplay experience.
User input and validation: The program prompts the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and validates the input to ensure it is one of the available options.
Outcome determination: The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the game rules (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper).
Score tracking: The program keeps track of the user's and computer's scores throughout the game and displays the final result at the end.
This project demonstrates the usage of fundamental Python concepts such as conditionals (if-elif statements), randomization, and list manipulation. It provides a simple yet engaging implementation of the popular Rock Paper Scissors game.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a learning resource or for your own entertainment!
